Timeline of Events
    Incident Detection and Initial Impact (10/08/2023, 10:00 am):
    Users started experiencing issues accessing the Medscape application. 
    Attempts to load the application resulted in a 500 internal server error. 
Investigation and Preliminary Analysis 
    The Medscape development team received reports about the error and initiated an investigation. 
    The team identified that the Apache server was returning the 500 error. 
    Initial analysis indicated a server-side issue that needed troubleshooting. 
Root cause and resolution
    Troubleshooting Process
        The development team accessed the Apache server logs to gather more information about the error. 
        The log analysis revealed potential causes such as misconfigurations, software bugs, or resource limitations.
        Further investigation revealed that a recent configuration change performed during maintenance had caused the issue.
